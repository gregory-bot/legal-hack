Multilingual Civic Education via SMS/WhatsApp
🧩 Problem
Over 17 million Kenyans, especially in marginalized and rural communities, lack access to reliable, understandable information about their rights, laws, and government services.
Barriers include:

Language exclusion (legal info only in English/Kiswahili)

Low digital access (smartphones, data bundles, literacy)

Mistrust/confusion over how to access help (e.g. NHIF, GBV, land rights)
