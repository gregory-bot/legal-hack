# CivicAI - Multilingual Civic Education via SMS/WhatsApp

### Problem
Over 17M Kenyans lack access to reliable, understandable civic/legal information due to digital exclusion and language barriers.

### Solution
CivicAI is an AI-powered civic education assistant that works via SMS and WhatsApp. It:
- Explains laws and services (land, ID, GBV, NHIF)
- Replies in local languages (Kiswahili, Kikuyu, Luo, etc.)
- Works with keyword prompts or voice notes
- Designed for offline/low-end phone use

### Tech Stack
- Python (backend with LangChain & RAG pipeline)
- Twilio SMS & WhatsApp API
- Language detection + translation (e.g., Azure/Google Translate APIs)
- Vector DB for law & rights embeddings

### Business Model
Donor-funded rollouts + Gov service delivery + Freemium tier + Civic trend analytics

### Impact
Empowering marginalized citizens with instant, understandable, localized civic knowledge.
